Analysis 

Observed trend 1 : The temperature at the equator trends highest, dropping off as you go north or south of the equator.
It kinda looks like a classic Gaussian distribution.

Observed trend 2 : Humidity looks high everwhere, I blame Al Gore.

Observed trend 3 : Cluodieness suprisingly seems to be focused across all latitudes.

4: Wind speed appears to be consistently random across all latitudes.
